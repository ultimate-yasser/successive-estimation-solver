# Successive Estimation Solver

Welcome to the Successive Estimation Solver! This program helps solve equations using the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods for successive estimation.

## Overview

Successive Estimation Solver is a Python program that allows users to input equations and solve them using the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods. It checks whether the provided matrix is diagonally dominant and organizes it if necessary before proceeding with the solution methods.

## Features

- Solves linear equations using Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods
- Checks if the matrix is diagonally dominant
- Organizes the matrix for better convergence
- Provides efficiency metrics for the solution methods
- Iterative approach for refining solutions

## Usage

To use the Successive Estimation Solver:

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the coefficients of the equations as prompted.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the initial guess and view the solution iterations.
